Test-time Data Augmentation for Estimation of Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty in Deep Neural Networks, MIDL 2018

We provide the codebase behind our paper titled 'Test-time Data Augmentation for Estimation of Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty in Deep Neural Networks' and presented at the International conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning in 
Amsterdam on the 6th of July 2018. Additionally, a notebook to demonstrate the use of our ResNet50-like CNN is included. 

During our study, we explored and implemented several ideas from the following papers:

Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. Deep residual learning for image recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 770–778, 2016.

Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. Identity mappings in deep residual networks. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 630–645. Springer, 2016.

Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.  Delving deep into rectifiers:  Surpassing human-level performance on imagenet classification. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 1026–1034, 2015.

While the notebook relies on the exact specifications described in the paper and readily can replicate the results, you may explore several variations if you feel comfortable getting into to the code.
